                Le Puy-en-Velay is twinned with several cities in Europe including Meschede which is a city in Germany and Tonbridge-Malling which is located in Great Britain. These two cities will therefore also organize the festival of artisans. We will have on one side, the FAM (festival of artisans in Meschede) and the FAT (festival of artisans in Tonbridge-Malling).
